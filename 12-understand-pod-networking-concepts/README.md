# Networking: Understand Pod Networking Concepts

Back to [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Tutorial](https://github.com/larkintuckerllc/k8s-cka-tutorial)

**note:** Includes the following additional topics:

* Networking: Understand the networking configuration on the cluster nodes

* Troubleshoot: Troubleshoot Application Failure

* Troubleshoot: Troubleshoot Networking

**Addendum**: Failed to show that the *iptables-save* command could be used to inspect the iptables that are managed by kube-proxy.

## Test Preparation: Relevant Kubernetes Documentation

Search *ipc* to find [Share Process Namespace between Containers in a Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace/).

## Script

### Sidebar into Container Logs

> Everything a containerized application writes to stdout and stderr is handled and redirected somewhere by a container engine.

*-Kubernetes-[Logging Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/)*

A simple example:

```plaintext
helm install dev debug
```

```plaintext
kubectl logs example-dev
```

**note:**: *--container* flag to specify container. *--previous* flag used to look at logs from previous container in case it crashes.

> However, the native functionality provided by a container engine or runtime is usually not enough for a complete logging solution. For example, if a container crashes, a pod is evicted, or a node dies, you’ll usually still want to access your application’s logs. As such, logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes, pods, or containers. This concept is called cluster-level-logging. Cluster-level logging requires a separate backend to store, analyze, and query logs. Kubernetes provides no native storage solution for log data, but you can integrate many existing logging solutions into your Kubernetes cluster.

### Pod Networking

> Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address for each address family. Every container in a Pod shares the network namespace, including the IP address and network ports. Containers inside a Pod can communicate with one another using localhost. When containers in a Pod communicate with entities outside the Pod, they must coordinate how they use the shared network resources (such as ports).

*-Kubernetes-[Pod Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/)*

> List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the network.

*-Kubernetes-[Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#podspec-v1-core)*

A simple example:

```plaintext
helm install dev networking
```

Follow logs:

```plaintext
kubectl logs example-dev --container httpd --follow
```

Login into *httpd* container:

```plaintext
kubectl exec example-dev -it --container httpd -- bash
```

View web page:

```plaintext
apt-get update
apt-get install curl -y
curl localhost
```

Observe source:

```plaintext
cat htdocs/index.html
```

Sidebar into logs: notice *logs* folder empty.

```plaintext
ls logs
```

Notice logs being sent to process' STDOUT:

```plaintext
grep CustomLog conf/httpd.conf
```

Can write directly to STDOUT (process id 1):

```plaintext
echo hello >> /proc/1/fd/1
```

Can also signal the process:

```plaintext
kill -HUP 1
```

Login into *ubuntu* container:

```plaintext
kubectl exec example-dev -it --container ubuntu -- bash
```

View web page:

```plaintext
apt-get update
apt-get install curl
curl localhost
```

Sidebar showing process on id 1:

```plaintext
ps -aux
```

### Cluster Networking

Notice IP address.

```plaintext
kubectl describe pod example-dev
```

```plaintext
helm install another tester
```

kubectl exec example-another -it -- bash

apt-get update
apt-get install curl -y
curl XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

How does does the traffic from this Pod (maybe on another Node) to this IP address make its way to the other Pod?

### Cluster Networking (Under the Hood)

Login to Node and curl address of Pod.

How is traffic to this IP address getting to Pod?

![Network Diagram](network.png)

First, notice that this IP address is allocated from the VPC subnet of the Nodes. This is because of the AWS Pod Networking add-on.

Next, look at AWS on Node EC2 and notice secondary IP address.  This means that Node will listen on this IP address.

```plaintext
ifconfig
```

```plaintext
route
```

### Pod IPC

Let us change things up and look at another way to communicate between containers.

> This page shows how to configure process namespace sharing for a pod. When process namespace sharing is enabled, processes in a container are visible to all other containers in that pod.
> You can use this feature to configure cooperating containers, such as a log handler sidecar container, or to troubleshoot container images that don’t include debugging utilities like a shell.

*-Kubernetes-[Share Process Namespace between Containers in a Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace/)*

```plaintext
helm install dev ipc
```

Look at logs:

```plaintext
kubectl logs example-dev --container httpd --follow
```

```plaintext
kubectl exec example-dev --container ubuntu -it -- bash
```

```plaintext
ps -aux
kill -HUP XX
```
